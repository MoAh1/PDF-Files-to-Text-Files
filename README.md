# **Azure Document Intelligence - PDF to Text Conversion**

## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**
This repository demonstrates how to use **Azure Document Intelligence** to convert **PDF files into text files** using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** technology.

## **ðŸ”§ How It Works**
- **Input:** A folder containing PDF files.
- **Processing:** The system extracts text from PDFs while maintaining structure and readability.
- **Output:** A folder containing text files.
- **Error Handling:** If the process is interrupted, it keeps a log of successfully processed files and resumes from where it left off.
- **Page Breaks:** Adds a page break marker between pages in the output text file.

## **ðŸ“ˆ Use Cases**
This tool is useful for:
- Enhancing the quality of **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems**.
- **Generating training datasets** for machine learning models.
- **Text analysis and NLP applications**.
- Extracting structured content from PDFs, including **tables, boxed content, and complex layouts**.

## **ðŸš€ Getting Started**
1. **Set up Azure Document Intelligence** and ensure your API keys are configured.
2. Place your **PDF files** inside the input folder.
3. Run the script to convert PDFs to text files.
4. Processed text files will be saved with page breaks for better readability.
