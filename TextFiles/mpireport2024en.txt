## Poverty amid conflict We are living in a time when layers of uncertainty exacerbate insecurity driven by violent conflicts, geopolitical tensions, the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a rapidly changing planetconstraining our ability to make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 Violent conflicts and their link to poverty, the theme explored in this year's report, are not only making it difficult to meet even very basic human needs in many parts of the world but also limiting prospects for the future for populations affected by them, particularly children and youth. Violent conflicts have surged in recent times. In 2023 there were more ongoing conflicts than at any time since the Second World War.2 The number of people forced to flee from their homes due to violent conflict, disasters or other factors reached an all-time high of 117 million.3 More civilian casualties in violent conflicts were recorded in 2022 than at any time since 2010.4 The years 2021, 2022 and 2023 recorded higher annual battle-related deaths than any year since the Cold War, leading to a total of more than 700,000 deaths globally.5 This 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report overlays violent conflict data with multidimensional poverty data to better understand their interlinkages across countries and over time. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) is the primary data source, but sensitivity analyses were also run using other key conflict datasets.6 The report finds that MPI values tend to be much higher in conflict-affected settings. And in countries affected by protracted conflict, poverty reduction is reversed, stagnant or slower through mechanisms illustrated by the case study on Afghanistan (see box 5 in part II) and figure 8. This year's update of the global MPI database includes new data from 20 countries. It presents MPI data from 112 countries covering 1,359 subnational regions. The results show that 1.1 billion of 6.3 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty, over half of them children. Common deprivations include a lack of adequate housing, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, nutrition and school attendance. Reaching the last mile to eliminate global poverty requires careful attention to people living in contexts of violent conflict. ### Key findings Across 112 countries and 6.3 billion people, 1.1 billion people (18.3 percent) live in acute multidimensional poverty (referred to as "poverty" throughout this report). ### Who are the poorest? · Over half of the 1.1 billion poor people are children under the age of 18 (584 million). Globally, 27.9 percent of children live in poverty, compared with 13.5 percent of adults. · 83.7 percent of poor people live in rural areas. Across all world regions people in rural areas are poorer than people in urban areas. Overall, 28.0 percent of the global rural population are poor, compared with 6.6 percent of the urban population. · 83.2 percent of the world's 1.1 billion multidimensionally poor people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa has 553 million people living in poverty, and South Asia, 402 million. · Nearly two-thirds of poor people live in middleincome countries (749 million, 65.2 percent). ### What deprivations do poor people experience? · Large proportions of the 1.1 billion poor people lack adequate sanitation (828 million), housing (886 million) and cooking fuel (998 million). <!-- PageFooter="POVERTY AMID CONFLICT" --> <!-- PageNumber="1" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

· Well over half of the 1.1 billion poor people live with a person who is undernourished in their household (637 million). In South Asia 272 million poor people live in households with at least one undernourished person, and in Sub-Saharan Africa 256 million do. · Around half of all poor people lack electricity (579 million), and over half live in a household where no one has completed six years of schooling (590 million). · Nearly half of all poor people do not have an improved source of drinking water (513 million). · 482 million poor people live in households where one or more children are out of school. ### How has poverty changed? · Of 86 countries with harmonized data, 76 significantly reduced poverty according to the MPI value in at least one time period. · Of 17 countries with trend data that end in 2021/22 or later,7 spanning at least part of the COVID-19 pandemic, only 9 (Benin, Cambodia, Comoros, the Kingdom of Eswatini, Kenya, Mozambique, the Philippines, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Trinidad and Tobago) experienced significant reductions in both MPI value and incidence of poverty.8 ### Do conflict-affected countries fare worse in poverty? · Of the 1.1 billion poor people, 218 million (19.0 percent) live in war-affected countries. Nearly 40.0 percent of poor people (455 million) live in countries experiencing war, fragility and/or low peacefulness, according to at least one of three widely used definitions.9 · While national rates vary, overall, in countries affected by war (using conflict definitions from UCDP), the incidence of poverty is 34.8 percent, much higher than the 10.9 percent in countries not affected by war or minor conflicts. Multidimensional poverty is also more than twice as high in fragile and conflictaffected and low-peacefulness countries. · On average, the percentage of poor people deprived in each of the 10 global MPI indicators is higher in conflict settings (as defined by UCDP) than in other countries; deprivations in nutrition, electricity, water and sanitation are some of the most pronounced among poor people in conflict settings. For example, in non-conflict-affected countries 5.6 percent of the population are poor and lack access to electricity. In war-affected countries this figure jumps to 26.9 percent. Similarly, while 4.4 percent of the population in non-conflictaffected countries are poor and have a child not attending school, the proportion increases to 17.7 percent in war-affected countries. · Poverty reduction tends to be slowest in the settings most affected by conflict-where poverty is the highest. So, people living in these contexts are being left behind in terms of multidimensional poverty. · In Afghanistan the incidence of poverty rose by more than 5 percentage points from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023. In 2022/2023 nearly two-thirds of Afghans were poor (64.9 percent), and almost three of every five poor people were children. · The difficulty of gathering data in countries and subregions affected by conflicts means that multidimensional poverty is likely underestimated. ### What is the global Multidimensional Poverty Index? The global MPI is a key international resource that measures acute multidimensional poverty across more than 100 developing countries (box 1). First launched in 2010 by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford and the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme, the global MPI advances SDG 1-ending poverty in all its forms everywhere-and measures interconnected deprivations across indicators related to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,7 and 11. Computation of the global MPI begins by constructing a deprivation profile for each household and person in it covering 10 indicators of health, education and standard of living (figure 1). For example, a household and all people living in it are deprived if any child is stunted or any child or adult for whom data are available is underweight; if any child died in the past five years; if any school-aged child <!-- PageFooter="GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX / 2024" --> <!-- PageNumber="2" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

is not attending school up to the age at which she or he would complete class 8; if no household member has completed six years of schooling; if the household lacks access to electricity; if the household lacks an improved source of drinking water within a 30-minute walk round trip;10 if the household lacks an improved sanitation facility that is not shared;11 if the household lacks nonsolid cooking fuel; if the household lacks durable housing materials; or if the household does not own more than one of these assets: a radio, animal cart, phone, television, computer, refrigerator, bicycle, motorcycle or car. All indicators are equally weighted within each dimension, so the health and education indicators are weighted 1/% each, and the standard of living indicators are weighted 1/18 each. A person's deprivation score is the sum of the weighted deprivations she or he experiences. The global MPI identifies people as multidimensionally poor if their deprivation score is 1/3 or higher (box 2). MPI values are the product of the incidence (H, or the proportion of people who live in multidimensional ### Box 1 Data used to compute the global Multidimensional Poverty Index The 2024 global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) uses the most recent comparable data available for 112 countries-21 low-income countries, 47 lower middle-income countries, 40 upper middle-income countries and 4 high-income countries (see table 1 at the end of the report). The global MPI shows who they are, where they live and what deprivations hold them back from achieving the wellbeing they deserve. Global MPI values, incidence and intensity of poverty, and component indicators are disaggregated for 1,359 subnational regions (for 102 countries) as well as by age group, rural-urban area and gender of the household head. The estimates are based on Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys for 55 countries, Demographic and Health Surveys for 44 countries and national surveys for 13 countries. The year of the surveys ranges from 2011/2012 to 2023. For 97 countries, home to 89.6 percent of poor people,1 data were fielded in 2015 or later-after the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted. Of these, 51 countries, home to 60.0 percent of poor people, have data fielded in 2019 or later. However, data from only 19 countries were collected as recently as 2021/2022 or later. These 19 countries are home to more than 723 million people, or around 11.5 percent of the 6.3 billion people globally, and include countries from every world region. The 2024 global MPI provides updated estimates for 20 countries: Afghanistan (2022/2023),2 Benin (2021/2022), Bhutan (2022), Burkina Faso (2021), Comoros (2022), Côte d'Ivoire (2021), Kingdom of Eswatini (2021/2022), Gabon (2019/2021), Ghana (2022), Kenya (2022), Mexico (2022), Mozambique (2022/2023), Nepal (2022), Peru (2022), the Philippines (2022), the United Republic of Tanzania (2022), Thailand (2022), Trinidad and Tobago (2022), Tunisia (2023) and Yemen (2022/2023). Trends in global MPI values are available for 86 countries using data from 2001 to 2023 (see table 2 at the end of the report). Of these countries, 40 have harmonized data for two points in time, 36 have data for three points in time, 6 have data for four points in time, 3 (Ghana, Mexico and Peru) have data for five points in time and 1 (Nepal) has data for six points in time. Of the 20 updated countries, 19 had harmonized MPI data, with only Bhutan missing harmonized MPI data. Harmonized trends are also available by subnational regions, age groups and rural-urban areas. Disaggregated trends help in monitoring the central, transformative promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: to leave no one behind. More frequent global MPI data are a strategic investment but are especially lacking in the poorest countries, where data can be well over 10 years out of date. For example, Niger (2012) is the poorest of the 112 countries and the poorest in Sub-Saharan Africa, Sudan (2014) is the poorest in the Arab States, and Bosnia and Herzegovina (2011/2012) is the second-poorest country in Europe and Central Asia. In each case their poverty data are out of date. Some 13 countries-Barbados (2012), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2011/2012), China (2014), Egypt (2014), El Salvador (2014), Libya (2014), the Republic of Moldova (2012), Namibia (2013), Nicaragua (2011/2012), Niger (2012), Saint Lucia (2012), Sudan (2014) and Ukraine (2012)-have data that are at least a decade old (from 2014 or earlier), highlighting the urgent need to update their poverty data. #### Notes 1\.

poverty) and intensity of poverty (A, or the average deprivation score among multidimensionally poor people). Put simply, MPI = H x A. MPI values range from 0 to 1, and higher values imply higher poverty. Global MPI values decline when fewer people are poor or when poor people have fewer deprivations. The precise definition of each indicator is available online, together with any country-specific adjustments and the computer code used to calculate the global MPI value for each country.12 By identifying who is poor, the nature of their poverty (their deprivation profile) and how poor they are (their deprivation score), the global MPI complements the international $2.15 a day poverty rate,13 bringing into view interlinked nonmonetary deprivations. <figure> <figcaption>Figure 1 Structure of the global Multidimensional Poverty Index</figcaption> Global Multidimensional Poverty Index Nutrition Health Child mortality Years of schooling Dimensions Education School attendance Indicators Cooking fuel Sanitation Drinking water Electricity Housing Assets Living standards </figure> Source: HDRO and OPHI. <!-- PageNumber="4" --> <!-- PageFooter="GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX / 2024" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Box 2 Nyakume's story and what the global Multidimensional Poverty Index measures" --> In the heart of the Mangateen internally displaced persons camp on the outskirts of Juba in the capital of South Sudan, a 22-year-old woman named Nyakume embodies resilience amid adversity.1 Forced to seek refuge at the camp following tribal conflicts at the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) Protection of Civilians Camp in Juba, Nyakume now shares a modest shelter with her father, stepmother, seven siblings and four extended family members, including her disabled cousin, within the congested settlement of more than 14,000 internally displaced persons. <figure> </figure> Originally hailing from a more stable life prior to the 2013 conflict in South Sudan and living in a comfortable home in Hai Referendum in Juba, Nyakume and her family now live in a dwelling that comprises three structures, fashioned from bamboo, wooden poles, mud and tattered plastic canvas, serving as a stark reminder of the upheaval they have endured. Nyakume's father, a college graduate and a former government employee, now toils as a security guard at a nearby nongovernmental organization, striving to support his family in their new reality at the internally displaced persons camp. Following disruptions caused by the 2013 conflict, a portion of Nyakume's family sought refuge in the Kakuma Refugee Camp from 2015 to 2022 for better access to essential services. However, economic challenges and high inflation prompted their return to Juba and to the UNMISS camp. Nyakume's family faces food scarcity, with limited access to regular meals and simple amenities. Nyakume's household is classified as nutritionally deprived because several members under 70 years of age are undernourished, per anthropometric measurements, due to prolonged food shortages. The absence of electricity, clean water and proper sanitation facilities in the camp poses additional challenges. To fetch water, Nyakume and her sisters embark on arduous one-hour roundtrip journeys to a communal well, where they often must wait in a long queue. Charcoal and firewood are the primary sources of cooking energy for the family. The family does not own any basic assets apart from two mobile phones. <table> <tr> <th rowspan="2">Health</th> <th>Nutrition</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Child mortality</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">Education</td> <td>Years of schooling</td> </tr> <tr> <td>School attendance</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="6">Living standards</td> <td>Cooking fuel</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sanitation</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Drinking water</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Electricity</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Housing</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Assets</td> </tr> </table> <figure> </figure> Note: Indicators in white refer to a nondeprivation. Despite these hardships, Nyakume's unwavering spirit shines through as she dreams of a brighter future, aspiring to pursue higher education to support her family and contribute to a more stable livelihood. All the children in the household have stopped attending school because the family can no longer afford tuition. As she navigates the uncertainties of displacement, Nyakume holds onto hope for a peaceful South Sudan and envisions a path towards empowerment and opportunity for herself and her loved ones. ### How the global Multidimensional Poverty Index measures Nyakume's deprivations According to the global Multidimensional Poverty Index, Nyakume and her family are poor.2 Their household deprivation score is 66.66 percent [1/6 + 1/6 + 6 x 1/18 = 2/3]. To be considered nonpoor, their deprivation score would need to be less than 33.3 percent. ### Notes 1\. South Sudan was previously included in the global Multidimensional Poverty Index tables and had the highest incidence of poverty (91.9 percent), based on its 2010 dataset. It has not appeared in the global MPI tables since 2023 because its data are out of date. The data revolution should not leave poverty data behind-especially for the poorest countries. 2. The global Multidimensional Poverty Index does not account for internally displaced persons because it relies on household data surveys. But multidimensional poverty impacts internally displaced persons, and better data and monitoring are needed to understand their experiences and address their specific needs. <!-- PageFooter="POVERTY AMID CONFLICT" --> <!-- PageNumber="5" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

## Part I The global Multidimensional Poverty Index in 2024 ### Who are the 1.1. billion poor people, and where do they live? In 112 countries 1.1 billion people of 6.3 billion are living in poverty. Nearly half (48.2 percent) of these poor people live in Sub-Saharan Africa (553 million), and over a third (35.0 percent) live in South Asia (402 million). So, 83.2 percent of poor people live in these two regions, while 9.1 percent live in East Asia and the Pacific (104 million), 4.6 percent in the Arab States (53 million), 3.0 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean (34 million) and 0.2 percent in Europe and Central Asia (2 million). Countries with the lowest Human Development Index (HDI) values tend to have the highest MPI values and the highest proportions of people in poverty, but a large share of poor people also live in medium HDI countries. Some 53.3 percent of all poor people live in low HDI countries. This corresponds to over half of all poor people (613 million). For example, low HDI countries Niger (2012),14 Chad (2019), the Central African Republic (2018/2019), Burundi (2016/2017), Madagascar (2021), Mali (2018), Guinea (2018), Ethiopia (2019), Afghanistan (2022/2023), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2017/18) and Burkina Faso (2021) have high MPI values and 64.5-91.0 percent of people living in poverty. The five countries with the largest number of people living in poverty are India (234 million), which is medium HDI, and Pakistan (93 million), Ethiopia (86 million), Nigeria (74 million) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (66 million), all low HDI. Together, these five countries account for nearly half (48.1 percent) of the 1.1 billion poor people. Low-income countries are home to only 10.2 percent of the population covered but to 34.8 percent of all poor people (400 million).15 Lower middle-income countries are home to 56.3 percent of all poor people, and upper middle-income countries, 8.9 percent. So, 65.2 percent of poor people (749 million) live in middle-income countries. A total of 144 million poor people live in 19 countries with data from 2021/22 or later, which may be considered post-COVID-19 pandemic data.16 These 19 countries account for only 12.5 percent of the 1.1 billion poor people, indicating that postpandemic data are still lacking for the majority of countries. This highlights the urgent need for the data revolution to prioritize poverty data from household surveys. ### Which groups are the poorest? #### Most poor people live in rural areas Of the 1.1 billion poor people, 962 million (83.7 percent) live in rural areas. This rural-urban poverty disparity is stark worldwide, with 28.0 percent of the rural population living in poverty compared with just 6.6 percent in urban areas. Some 70.7 percent of all poor people live in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa (463 million) and South Asia (350 million). #### Substantial disparities in poverty across 1,359 subnational regions Of Sub-Saharan Africa's 550 subnational regions, 303, home to 80.4 percent of poor people in the region, have an incidence of poverty of 50 percent or higher. The incidence of poverty is also over 50 percent for 34 of the 124 subnational regions in South Asia. Notably, across the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, poverty ranges from 27.9 percent in Kabul to a distressing 91.1 percent in Zabul, and in 7 provinces, over 87.5 percent of people are poor. Across the Arab States the incidence of poverty is over 50 percent in 19 of the 144 subnational regions. Yemen is home to six such regions, with the highest <!-- PageFooter="POVERTY AMID CONFLICT" --> <!-- PageNumber="7" --> <!-- PageBreak -->


Page 12
poverty rates in Reimah (82.7 percent) and Al-Jawf (70.9 percent). But in the Arab States half of all poor people live in subnational regions where the incidence of poverty is below 50 percent; in South Asia nearly four poor people in five live in lower incidence regions. #### Children experience a far higher incidence of poverty Of the 1.1 billion people living in poverty, over half (584 million) are children under the age of 18. Across all 112 countries 27.9 percent of children are multidimensionally poor, more than twice the proportion of adults (13.5 percent). Over half of poor children reside in Sub-Saharan Africa, amounting to 317 million children for whom poverty reduction is a critical regional priority. This is followed by South Asia (184 million poor children). The disparities across age groups are sobering in the South Asian nation of Afghanistan: 70 percent of children under the age of 18 are poor compared with 57.8 percent of adults. While half of the world's poor are children, the proportion in Afghanistan is even higher, at 58.9 percent. In raw numbers Afghanistan has about 5 million more poor children than adults (15.5 million poor children and 10.8 million poor adults). Deprivations in school attendance and nutrition contribute the most to poverty. For example, 52.3 percent of Afghans are poor and live with an out-of-school child, and 44.2 percent are poor and live with an undernourished child under the age of 5. One might assume that the proportion of children among the poor population would decrease sharply in countries with a low incidence of poverty. But in many very low poverty contexts, child poverty remains a concern (figure 2). In Argentina, where the incidence of poverty is lower than in most countries (0.4 percent), the share of children among all poor people is 53.7 percent. In Turkmenistan, where the incidence of poverty is 0.2 percent, 10,000 of the 18,000 poor people are children (53.4 percent). In Tonga, where the incidence of poverty is 0.9 percent, 56.0 percent of poor people are children. In Jordan, the incidence of poverty is 0.4 percent, yet 52.8 percent of poor people are children. ### What deprivations do poor people experience? The largest numbers of poor people are deprived in cooking fuel, housing and sanitation. But deprivations in nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling and school attendance carry a higher weight (see figure 1). Examining the contribution of each indicator to MPI value takes into account both the number of deprivations and their weight. Across 112 countries each deprivation of the global MPI afflicts large numbers of people. Of the 1.1 billion poor people, 828 million lack adequate sanitation, 886 million lack housing and 998 million lack cooking fuel. Well over half of the 1.1 billion poor people are deprived in nutrition (637 million). In South Asia 272 million poor people are deprived in nutrition, and in Sub-Saharan Africa 256 million. Over half of all poor people lack electricity (579 million). And, alarmingly, over half of all poor people live in a household where no member has completed six years of schooling (590 million). Nearly half of all poor people are deprived of drinking water (513 million). And despite the multiple benefits of education, 482 million poor people live in households where one or more children are out of school. The MPI value is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.254), where the indicators contributing most to poverty are years of schooling, school attendance and nutrition, which together account for nearly half of the MPI value in roughly equal proportions (figure 3). A detailed examination of Burkina Faso (2021), a country at war, reveals considerable subnational disparities (see figure 3), with incidences of poverty ranging from 20.6 percent to 88.1 percent and MPI values from 0.088 to 0.614. School attendance, nutrition and years of schooling remain the primary contributors. Notably, in 9 of the 13 subnational regions the incidence of poverty is above 70.0 percent, and the intensity of poverty is at least 49.4 percent. To end poverty in all its forms, the interlinked deprivations of poor people need to be addressed to reduce the intensity of poverty and empower poor people to exit poverty.

Multidimensional poverty metrics complement monetary poverty metrics by measuring nonmonetary deprivations. In 50 of the 68 countries with monetary poverty data fielded within 3.5 years of MPI data, the incidence of multidimensional poverty is higher than the incidence of extreme monetary poverty, measured by the World Bank at $2.15 a day. Of these 50 countries, 16 are upper middle income, and 1 is high income. In 13 of the 50 countries, the percentage of people living in multidimensional poverty is at least 30 percentage points higher than the percentage experiencing monetary poverty. Chad, Guinea and Mauritania are particularly striking, with differences of more than 50 percentage points between the two measures. Conversely, in 18 countries the incidence of monetary poverty is higher than that of multidimensional poverty. These findings highlight the complex and varied ways poverty affects human lives across regions. <!-- PageNumber="10" --> <!-- PageFooter="GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX / 2024" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

### How has poverty changed? In 86 countries, covering around 6 billion people, data from one or several periods have been harmonized to examine how poverty has evolved. Of these countries, 76 experienced a statistically significant absolute reduction in global MPI value over at least one time period (74 countries reduced the incidence of poverty), and 20 experienced a statistically significant reduction across at least two time periods.17 The Kingdom of Eswatini, Nepal, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania experienced a significant reduction in MPI value and incidence of poverty over three time periods. Among the 10 countries with the fastest annualized absolute reduction in MPI value, 7 are in Sub-Saharan Africa (Sierra Leone, 20132017; Togo, 2013/2014-2017; the Kingdom of Eswatini, 2006/2007-2010; Ethiopia, 2016-2019; Liberia, 2007-2013; Guinea, 2012-2016; and Mali, 20152018), 2 are in East Asia and the Pacific (Timor-Leste, 2009/2010-2016) and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (2011/2012-2017) and 1 is in South Asia (Nepal, 2006-2011). Kyrgyzstan (2005/20062018), North Macedonia (2005/2006-2018/2019) and Serbia (2010-2019) had the fastest annualized reduction relative to their starting MPI value. Of the 17 countries with trend data ending in 2021/2022 or later, 7 had no significant poverty reduction, 1 (Afghanistan) had a significant increase in poverty, and only 9 experienced a significant reduction in MPI value.18 Cambodia (2014-2021/2022) and Benin (2017/2018-2021/22) had the fastest reductions in MPI values and in incidence of poverty: from 66.0 percent to 55.9 percent in Benin (figure 4). Six of the nine are in Sub-Saharan Africa, two are in East Asia and the Pacific and one is in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Afghanistan (2015/2016-2022/2023) poverty increased significantly, and an additional 5.3 million Afghans became poor (see box 5 in part II). More data are required before drawing any conclusions about post-COVID-19 pandemic trends. <figure> <figcaption>Figure 4 Ten countries with recent data experienced a statistically significant annualized absolute change in Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value</figcaption> Change in MPI value 0.010 Afghanistan (2015/2016-2022/2023) 0.005 0.000 Trinidad and Tobago (2011-2022) Philippines (2017-2022) -0.005 Eswatini (Kingdom of) (2014-2021/2022) Mozambique (2011-2022/2023) -0.010 Kenya (2014-2022) Comoros (2012-2022) Tanzania (United Republic of) (2015/2016-2022) -0.015 Cambodia (2014-2021/2022) -0.020 Benin (2017/2018-2021/2022) </figure> Note: Change is significant at the 95 percent confidence level.

## Part II Poverty in conflict areas Wars and violent conflicts leave deep and lasting scars on lives in myriad ways. They decimate assets, including housing and infrastructure associated with the provision of services such as clean water, sanitation and electricity, as the functioning of institutions is disrupted and sometimes outright collapses. Children's schooling is interrupted, and undernutrition may surge due to food insecurity or forced displacement. Conflict casts a long shadow into the future, resulting in lives lost, physical disabilities accrued, livelihoods and production processes disrupted and trauma and poor mental health exacerbated. Conflict and poverty often exacerbate each other in a destructive cycle.19 Conflict directly aggravates poverty by adversely affecting the economy20 and widening inequality.21 Wars damage schools, hospitals, water systems and roads, making it difficult for communities to access basic services. Poverty makes societies more vulnerable to conflict,22 as it may create horizontal inequalities, exclusion and perceptions of injustice.23 Part II studies the links between multidimensional poverty and conflict. Data on conflict are primarily from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), which classifies countries experiencing conflict events into two groups: those in war and those experiencing minor conflict. The analysis here explores how poverty differs in these conflict settings, both in Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) values and in all the MPI indicators, such as access to drinking water, nutrition and school attendance. The differences are salient across countries and over time. Together they paint a sobering picture of how violent conflict hinders global poverty reduction efforts, potentially reversing decades of progress and clouding future prospects. They underscore that effectively addressing the last-mile challenges of eliminating global poverty is closely tied to preventing conflict and fostering peace (box 3).24 ### A disproportionate number of poor people live in conflict settings Nearly 40 percent of the 1.1 billion poor people (455 million) live in countries25 experiencing conflict, according to one or more of the three widely used definitions (box 4). That includes 218 million people living in countries at war, 335 million living in fragile or conflict-affected situations and 375 million living in very low or low peace contexts. Some 289 million (25.1 percent) experience two or more of these three conditions, while 184 million (16.0 percent) experience all three. While 10.0 percent of the global population live in countries affected by war, 19.0 percent (218 million) of the world's poor population is living in war-affected countries based on the UCDP dataset for the year of the survey used in the global MPI.26 These numbers indicate that the proportion of poor people is disproportionately higher in conflict-affected states. ### The incidence of poverty is highest in conflict-affected states All three datasets demonstrate that the incidence of poverty in countries experiencing conflict, fragility and/or low peacefulness is more than twice as high as in all other countries (figure 5). Under UCDP classifications, the incidence of poverty is highest in war-affected countries, at 34.8 percent, compared with 22.6 percent in minor conflict areas. Both rates are higher than the 10.9 percent in all other countries. Similarly, under the World Bank fragile and conflict-affected situations list classifications, the aggregate headcount in fragile or conflictaffected countries (45.1 percent) is substantially higher than that in all other countries (14.7 percent). Under the Global Peace Index classifications, 50.2 percent of people living in very low peace contexts are poor, as are 27.8 percent living in low peace <!-- PageFooter="GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX / 2024" --> <!-- PageNumber="12" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

### Box 3 Ongoing conflicts around the world Current conflicts are imposing a heavy human toll, marked by widespread loss of lives and large-scale displacements.1 In Africa state-based conflict-related deaths surpassed 150,000 in 2022, a record high for the region,2 as the continent became home to 28 of the 59 active state-based conflicts worldwide.3 The ongoing war in Ukraine had created 6 million refugees as of the end of 2023, and more than 9 million people were internally displaced in Sudan in the year following the outbreak of the civil war in 2023.4 The conflict in Gaza has resulted in an estimated 83 percent of the total population being internally displaced, a condition further aggravated by the destruction of over 60 percent of Gaza's housing stock, as of the end of 2023.5 Displacement due to violent conflict gravely affects people's ability to access health and education, further exacerbating multidimensional poverty. The armed confrontations in Sudan, for example, have damaged more than 10,400 schools, depriving 19 million children of education.6 Health and sanitation are tremendously impacted by conflict, due to the destruction of facilities, the inaccessibility of resources through altered commerce and medicine distribution, and in some cases the lack of clean water and electricity, essential to run hospitals. After eight years of conflict only 54 percent of Yemen's health facilities are fully functioning, leaving the health system unable to deliver enough assistance to meet the population's needs.7 In Sudan access to sanitation and hygiene has become critical, with nearly 15 million people unable to access water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities in 2023.8 The conflict in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia critically damaged water infrastructure, reducing the supply of water to rural and urban populations by over 50 percent and exposing more than 3.7 million people to a shortage of drinking water and water-related diseases.9 In Chad, South Sudan and Sudan nearly 28 million people face acute food insecurity, a situation that worsened as a result of the ongoing war in Sudan.10 The destruction of infrastructure and the environment compounds the long-term costs of war. The cost of the damaged infrastructure in the first four months of war in Gaza is estimated to be $18.5 billion.11 Gazan towns are now covered in 39 million tonnes of debris, causing major risks to people's health-not to speak of the destruction of wastewater facilities, sewage plants and solid waste management infrastructure, which has resulted in the pollution of drinking water, soil and coastal waters.12 The cost of reconstruction and repair since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is estimated to be $486 billion over the next decade.13 In Northeastern Nigeria the ongoing conflict has caused a cumulative loss of $91.2-$112.8 billion over 2008-2021, which impacts the economic stability of the country and the region as a whole.14 #### Notes 1\.

The report uses three measures of conflict, fragility, and peacefulness in analysing the incidence of poverty. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program Georeferenced Event Dataset Global Version 24.1 Codebook categorizes conflict-affected countries into those experiencing war and those experiencing minor conflict based on the number of conflict-related deaths observed per year.1 The World Bank's list of fragile and conflict-affected situations includes countries in conflict as well as those in contexts of institutional fragility.2 And the Global Peace Index, produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace, ranks 163 independent states and territories based on their level of peacefulness according to 23 indicators in three domains: militarization, safety and security, and ongoing conflict.3 Across the 112 countries with global MPI values, 1 person in 6 (1.1 billion) lives in a low or very low peace context, 1 in 9 (742 million) lives in a conflict-affected or fragile state and 1 in 10 (628 million) lives in a country at war. One person in five (1.3 billion) lives in one of the 32 countries that fall into at least one of these categories. #### Notes 1\. UCDP 2024a, 2024b. 2. World Bank 2023b. 3.

Overall, 34.1 percent of people living in low or very low peace contexts, 375 million people, are multidimensionally poor. The population-weighted mean global MPI value of countries affected by war is larger than the population-weighted mean of countries in minor conflict, which is in turn larger than the populationweighted mean of all other countries (figure 6). But the countries in each group have a broad range of global MPI values, meaning that conflict is an important driver of poverty-but not the only one. Some of the poorest countries are affected by conflict. The share of the population who are poor is 84.2 percent in Chad, 80.4 percent in the Central African Republic and 75.1 percent in Burundi. This paints a stark picture of where poor people live and how closely poverty is linked to conflict. <!-- PageNumber="14" --> <!-- PageFooter="GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX / 2024" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

Source: Authors' calculations based on UCDP (2024a). ### Conflict-affected countries are more deprived in all Multidimensional Poverty Index indicators On average, the percentage of poor people deprived in all 10 global MPI indicators is higher in countries in conflict settings (as classified by UCDP) than in other countries; deprivations in nutrition, electricity, water and sanitation are some of the most pronounced (figure 7). For instance, 5.6 percent of the population in non-conflict-affected countries are poor and lack electricity compared with 26.9 percent in waraffected countries. Similarly, 4.4 percent of the population in non-conflict-affected countries are poor and have a child who is not attending school compared with 17.7 percent in war-affected countries. And 7.2 percent of the population in non-conflict-affected countries are poor and deprived in nutrition compared with 20.8 percent in war-affected countries. Being poor and deprived in child mortality is a tragic situation that is far more prevalent in war-affected countries (8.0 percent of the population compared with 1.1 percent). ### Poverty reduction is slower in conflict-affected countries Conflicts have been intensifying in recent years, pushing millions of people into humanitarian crises and risking setbacks in progress on poverty reduction in the long term.27 According to the Global Peace Index 2024, 97 countries experienced a decline in peacefulness, the highest number since the index was created in 2008. In 2023, 79 state-based conflicts affected 47 countries, 120 non-state-based conflicts affected 29 countries and 86 conflicts were targeted against civilians in 46 countries.28 Furthermore, conflicts have become deadlier. The UCDP dataset reveals a sharp rise in fatalities due to organized violence, from 236,000 in 2021 to 311,000 in 2022. The disruption of conflict alongside the pressure of poverty makes it increasingly difficult for affected regions to break free from the grip of both. To explore whether the pace of poverty reduction is affected by conflict, global MPI trend data were investigated for 86 countries in the 2024 dataset, <!-- PageFooter="POVERTY AMID CONFLICT" --> <!-- PageNumber="15" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

The proportion of people who are poor and deprived in each indicator is calculated using only information from countries with data on that indicator. Countries that are missing data for a particular indicator are excluded from the analysis of that indicator. Source: Authors' calculations based on table 1 at the end of the report, and conflict data based on UCDP (2024b). sorted by UCDP conflict status category. Countries that were affected by conflict in either year of observation were considered conflict affected. Some war-affected countries still managed to reduce poverty despite the daunting conditions that their population suffers daily. But a dark shadow still lurks over this positive result, as the pace of poverty reduction in war-affected countries is less than half that in more peaceful countries. The average annualized relative reduction rate in MPI value is 7.8 percent for non-conflict-affected countries (weighted by the number of poor people and then aggregated) compared with 3.0 percent in war-affected countries (figure 8),29 so the size of the annual step towards zero poverty was far smaller in war-affected countries. In absolute terms, the weighted average annualized reduction in MPI value is 0.008 in war-affected countries, slower than the 0.012 in minor conflict countries and on par with the value in non-conflictaffected countries. Because war-affected countries have higher starting levels of poverty, they need a far faster absolute reduction than non-conflict-affected countries. Clearly, conflict snarls progress on the first Sustainable Development Goal, ending poverty in all its forms. ### Data gaps lead to underestimates of poor people living in conflict settings Data gaps are a challenge in estimating how many poor people live in conflict situations because the household surveys that underpin the MPI dataset are difficult to conduct in conflict-affected countries. For example, based on the UCDP dataset, 64 developing countries (irrespective of whether they <!-- PageFooter="GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX / 2024" --> <!-- PageNumber="16" --> <!-- PageBreak -->


Page 21
were included in the 2024 global MPI dataset) were identified as conflict-affected or experiencing minor conflict or war at least once over the survey period of 2012-2023. But only 29 countries had MPI surveys conducted in the same years as the conflict. The remaining 35 experienced conflict at least once between 2012 and 2023 but did not have MPI surveys conducted in the years the country was affected by conflict.30 The existence of MPI surveys for 29 countries affected by conflict demonstrates the tremendous effort of data providers in collecting and collating data where possible. But the gap between MPI data and conflict data suggests a potential underestimation of the number of multidimensionally poor people living in conflict-affected areas. ### Next steps in reducing the impact of conflict on poverty This report's analysis of conflict reveals a stark reality: Poverty is markedly higher in conflict-affected settings, and the presence of conflict stalls or reverses poverty reduction. Over half of the 1.1 billion people living in poverty are children. Countries engulfed in war face severe setbacks in development, as infrastructure crumbles, access to essential services becomes limited and livelihoods are destroyed. People living in conflict-affected regions are not only grappling with the immediate impacts of violence but are also trapped in cycles of poverty that perpetuate their suffering across generations. This report has shown that 19.0 percent (218 million) of the world's poor people live in countries affected by war and that 40 percent (455 million) of the world's poor people live in countries experiencing conflict, fragility and/or low peace. War-affected countries have a significantly higher incidence of poverty (34.8 percent) than nonconflict-affected countries (10.9 percent). The Global Peace Index further highlights that over half of the population lives in poverty in very low peace contexts compared with 15.1 percent in more peaceful countries. Conflict exacerbates deprivation across multiple dimensions, including access to essential services such as nutrition, electricity, water and sanitation. Poverty reduction efforts are often stalled or reversed in conflict-affected areas, as evidenced by rising poverty in countries such as Absolute annualized change in Multdimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value <figure> <figcaption>Figure 8 Conflict hinders poverty reduction</figcaption> 0.000 -0.002 -0.004 All other countries -0.008 -0.006 War -0.008 -0.008 Minor conflict -0.010 -0.012 -0.012 -0.014 </figure> <figure> <figcaption>Relative annualized change in MPI value (%)</figcaption> 0 -1 -2 War -3.0 -3 -4 -5 -6 All other countries -7.8 Minor conflict -8.0 -7 -8 </figure> Source: Authors' calculations based on poverty data from Alkire, Kanagaratnam and Suppa (2024c) and conflict data from UCDP (2024a). Afghanistan (box 5). Additionally, the challenges of data collection in conflict zones likely lead to an underestimation of the true extent of multidimensional poverty in these regions. Overall, the findings call for urgent global action to prioritize these conflict-affected settings, to ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of poverty eradication. They also imply the need for serious and sustained efforts to prevent further conflict from shattering infrastructure, rolling back progress and ballooning the cost of development. The international community must work together to provide targeted support, rebuild shattered systems and create pathways for those most impacted by conflict to escape <!-- PageFooter="POVERTY AMID CONFLICT" --> <!-- PageNumber="17" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

### Box 5 Multidimensional poverty in conflict-affected Afghanistan Afghanistan has experienced a prolonged state of conflict and instability, subjecting the population to extreme hardship for decades and making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries in the world. #### Conflict intensified between the two Multidimensional Poverty Index survey periods Afghanistan has experienced severe civil conflict since the late 1970s, culminating with the takeover by the Taliban as the de facto authorities in August 2021. The two surveys from 2015/2016 and 2022/2023 provide the opportunity to use harmonized trend data and explore the evolution of multidimensional poverty as the conflict intensified for most of the 2015-2023 period. From 2015 to 2019 there was a steady increase in conflict-related deaths,1 from nearly 18,000 to slightly more than 30,000. In 2020 conflict-related deaths fell to about 21,000. However, 2021 saw a surge to around 36,000 deaths. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 marked a watershed, with conflict-related deaths falling to 1,600 in 2022 and 335 in 2023. #### Significant increase in Afghanistan's global Multidimensional Poverty Index value over time From 2015/2016 to 2022/2023 poverty rose by more than 5.2 percentage points, with 5.3 million additional people-1 in 20 Afghans-falling into multidimensional poverty (figure B5.1). The incidence of poverty increased by 5.2 percentage points between 2015/2016 and 2022/2023, and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value increased sharply. This analysis is hampered by the lack of nutrition data in the 2015/2016 Demographic and Health Survey (nutrition was a visible deprivation in 2022/2023) and the lack of cooking fuel data in 2022/2023. So, the change in harmonized MPI value over time for Afghanistan is based on eight indicators and as such may understate the level and change in poverty. To be precise, the incidence of poverty in Afghanistan was 64.9 percent in 2022/2023, but when the nutrition indicator is dropped to assess trends, the value falls to 52.2 percent. Despite these limits, the results make important trends visible. <figure> <figcaption>Figure B5.1 The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value and the incidence of poverty increased in Afghanistan between the two survey periods</figcaption> MPI value Incidence of poverty (%) 0.280 53 52.2 0.268 0.270 52 0.260 51 50 0.250 49 0.240 0.234 48 46.9 0.230 47 0.220 46 45 2015/2016 2022/2023 2015/2016 2022/2023 </figure> Note: Based on harmonized trend data that lack two indicators: nutrition and cooking fuel.

Poverty trends in Afghanistan during this period must be analysed alongside large migration and population movements-for example, the populations of Helmand and Urozgan more than doubled.

<!-- PageHeader="Box 5 Multidimensional poverty in conflict-affected Afghanistan (continued)" --> #### The stark divide between rural and urban areas persists The increase in poverty from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023 was driven by worsening conditions in both rural and urban areas, whose population shares were stable. The incidence of poverty increased by 6.3 percentage points in rural areas and by 3.8 percentage points in urban areas. Similarly, MPI values increased significantly in both rural and urban areas.

Source: Alkire, Kanagaratnam and Suppa 2024c. #### The incidence of poverty increased considerably among children Prolonged conflict and instability have resulted in extensive human and material losses and severely affected children. From 2015/2016 to 2022/2023 the incidence of poverty increased by 7 percentage points among children compared with 3 percentage points among adults-an especially sobering trend that merits a response. Decades of armed conflict, sociopolitical and humanitarian crises, along with natural disasters, have disrupted the education system in Afghanistan. From 2015/2016 to 2022/2023 the proportion of Afghans living in poor households with out-of-school children rose from 35.0 percent to 43.8 percent (figure B5.3). The ban by the de facto authorities on the education of girls beyond year six will severely exacerbate this situation, resulting in a generation of young women denied their basic right to education. Notably, children living in rural areas were disproportionately affected, as deprivation in school attendance increased from 42.3 percent to 52.7 percent in rural areas and from 12.3 percent to 17.7 percent in urban areas. Such widespread deprivations not only inevitably influence the present but could also influence the future of Afghan children, as lack of education limits employment opportunities and increases the risk of early marriage and domestic violence for girls.

The 2019 national A-MPI was calculated using data from the 2016-2017 Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey. The A-MPI consists of five dimensions and 18 indicators, whereas the global MPI has three dimensions and 10 indicators and is an annual measure used to compare multidimensional poverty across more than 100 countries. While the global MPI is intended for cross-country comparisons, the national MPI is tailored to the context of each country, meaning that the two measures are not comparable. 1\. UCDP 2024a. 2. In the DHS 2015, due to security issues in rural Zabul, only seven urban clusters could be covered. Therefore, the population share based on the sample does not accurately reflect Zabul's actual share in Afghanistan's total population. the grip of multidimensional poverty. Critical components of this effort include enhancing data collection methods in these regions, using innovative technologies and forging partnerships with local organizations to access hard-to-reach areas and ensure accurate data. Prioritizing funding and resources to improve data infrastructure in conflict zones is essential to capture the true extent of poverty and effectively target interventions. Addressing multidimensional poverty in conflictaffected contexts requires a comprehensive approach that integrates peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation to build resilience and support sustainable recovery. Conflict affects people, especially the poorest, in myriad ways. If the root causes and consequences of conflict and poverty are tackled using data and deft determination, poor people can have the chance to rebuild their lives and communities. <!-- PageFooter="GLOBAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX / 2024" --> <!-- PageNumber="20" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

It is possible that in the time period between surveys, changes in poverty were volatile-for instance, declining just before the COVID-19 pandemic and then rising slightly during the pandemic but not above the rate during the earlier survey date.

While these data sources are valuable, their infrequent and irregular collection means that they rarely reflect recent developments or current situations. Although recent contexts and evolving conditions are discussed, the analysis cannot fully capture the most recent developments with the available data. 25 The 32 countries experiencing conflict according to one or more of the three definitions are Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iraq, Kiribati, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Mexico, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, State of Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Sudan, Timor-leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Yemen and Zimbabwe. <table> <tr> <td>27</td> <td>UCDP 2024a.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>28</td> <td>UCDP 2024a.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29</td> <td>The years and duration of measured trends vary, so these values can only be illustrative.</td> </tr> </table> 26 The values in part II are compiled using the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset Global version 24.1, which combines state-based, non-state-based and one-side violence. UCDP measures conflicts by the number of conflict-related deaths: countries with 25-999 deaths in a given year are classified as countries in minor conflict for that year, and countries with 1,000 or more deaths in a given year are classified as countries in war in that year. The conflict status of a country was checked based on the same year the MPI data were collected. For example, the MPI survey for Burkina Faso took place in 2021, so the UCDP data on the number of conflict-related deaths in 2021 were used. If a country was not included in the UCDP dataset, if the MPI survey year was missing or if there were fewer than 25 conflict-related deaths in the survey year, the country was included in the category "all other countries." This approach of aligning UCDP data with the MPI survey year is consistently applied throughout the report. 30 Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, El Salvador, Eritrea, Guinea, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, the Kingdom of Eswatini, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Niger, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, the United Republic of Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela. <!-- PageFooter="POVERTY AMID CONFLICT" --> <!-- PageNumber="21" --> <!-- PageBreak -->

TABLE 1 ### Notes a Not all indicators were available for all countries, so caution should be used in cross-country comparisons. When an indicator is missing, weights of available indicators are adjusted to total 100 percent. See Technical Note at https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents /mpi2024technicalnotes.pdf and OPHI Methodological Note 58 at https://ophi.org.uk/publications/MN-58 for details. b D indicates data from Demographic and Health Surveys, M indicates data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, N indicates data from national surveys and ^ indicates data from Pan Arab Population and Family Health Surveys (see https://hdr.undp.org/mpi-2024-faqs and OPHI Methodological Note 58 at https://ophi.org.uk /publications/MN-58 for the list of national surveys). c Data refer to the most recent year available during the period specified. d Missing indicator on cooking fuel. e Value is not reported because it is based on a small number of multidimensionally poor people. f Urban areas only. g Considers child deaths that occurred at any time because the survey did not collect the date of child deaths. h Missing indicator on nutrition. i Revised estimate from the 2022 MPI based on the survey microdata update. j Missing indicator on child mortality. k Child mortality data were not used because the data were collected from a sample of women ages 15-49 that was not representative of the female population in that age group. l Anthropometric data were collected from all children under age 5 and from selected individuals who are age 5 or older. Construction of the nutrition indicator was restricted to children under age 5 since the anthropometric sample is representative of the under 5 population. m Indicator on sanitation follows the national classification in which pit latrine with slab is considered unimproved. n Following the national report, latrines are considered an improved source for the sanitation indicator. o The analytical sample was restricted to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey sample, and its sample weight was used, because child mortality information was not collected for the National Immunization Coverage Survey sample. p Because of the high proportion of children excluded from nutrition indicators due to measurements not being taken, estimates based on the 2019 Serbia Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey should be interpreted with caution. The unweighted sample size used for the multidimensional poverty calculation is 82.8 percent. q Missing indicator on school attendance. r The analytical sample was restricted to the round 2 sample because standard of living questions were not collected for the round 1 sample. s Missing indicator on housing. t Revised estimate from the 2020 MPI. u Captures only deaths of children under age 5 who died in the last five years and deaths of children ages 12-18 years who died in the last two years. v The methodology was adjusted to account for the missing indicator on nutrition and the incomplete indicator on child mortality (the survey did not collect the date of child deaths). w Based on the version of data accessed on 7 June 2016. x ☒ Given the information available in the data, child mortality was constructed based on deaths that occurred between surveys-that is, between 2012 and 2014. Child deaths reported by an adult man in the household were taken into account because the date of death was reported. ### Definitions Multidimensional Poverty Index: Proportion of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations. Multidimensional poverty headcount: Population with a deprivation score of at least 33.3 percent. It is expressed as a share of the population in the survey year, the number of multidimensionally poor people in the survey year and the projected number of multidimensionally poor people in 2022. Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty. Inequality among the poor: Variance of individual deprivation scores of poor people. It is calculated by subtracting the deprivation score of each multidimensionally poor person from the intensity, squaring the differences and dividing the sum of the weighted squares by the number of multidimensionally poor people. Population in severe multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population in severe multidimensional poverty-that is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more. Population vulnerable to multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivationsthat is, those with a deprivation score of 20-33.3 percent. Contribution of deprivation in dimension to overall multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the Multidimensional Poverty Index attributed to deprivations in each dimension. Population living below national poverty line: Percentage of the population living below the national poverty line, which is the poverty line deemed appropriate for a country by its authorities. National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys. Population living below PPP $2.15 a day: Percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $2.15 (in 2017 purchasing power parity [PPP] terms) a day. ### Main data sources Column 1: Refers to the year and the survey whose data were used to calculate the country's Multidimensional Poverty Index value and its components. Columns 2-12: HDRO and OPHI calculations based on data on household deprivations in health, education, and standard of living from various surveys listed in column 1 using the methodology described in Technical Note (https://hdr.undp.org/system /files/documents/mpi2024technicalnotes.pdf) and OPHI Methodological Note 58 (https://ophi.org.uk/publications/MN-58).

Multidimensional poverty headcount: Population with a deprivation score of at least 33.3 percent. It is expressed as a share of the population in the survey year and the number of poor people in the survey year. Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty. People who are multidimensionally poor and deprived in each indicator: Percentage of the population that is multidimensionally poor and deprived in the given indicator (censored headcount ratio). #### Main data sources Column 1: Refers to the year and the survey whose data were used to calculate the country's MPI value and its components.
